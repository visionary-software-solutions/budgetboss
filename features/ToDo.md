I have yet to find a budget application that works the way I want it to, so I am going to make one. The goal of this is to be supremely flexible, but I'm definitely going to be focusing on the paycheck-to-paycheck crowd initially with the features.

To-Do List : BudgetBoss

		       <li>And: From there, make changes to any/all aspects of the Budget (specific editing features listed seperately)</li>
